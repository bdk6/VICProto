VIC20 22/44 prototyping board

This is a prototyping board with 22/44-.156 edge card connector.  I made
it primarily for the VIC20 expansion bus, but it is a good generic board
with 22/44 edge card that will work for many purposes.  I designed it to
meet the criteria for [JLCPCB's](https://jlcpcb.com/) "$2 special."
